This repository contains the resources and examples for our Special Topic Project ***Test Automation Best Practices: A Case Study Analysis***. This demonstration focuses on implementing test automation using the [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) to demonstrate test automation processes.

This project aims to showcase the implementation of test automation in software development. By using the Robot Framework, we explore the best practices in automating tests for web applications, leveraging the power of the Selenium library for browser interactions.


## How to set up the environment

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org) and add them to the Environment Variable.

   > We used Python 3.10.6 on our demonstration
   

2. Install [JDK](https://jdk.java.net/archive).

   > We used openjdk version "17.0.2" on our demonstration

   The project language is robot framework and the editor is RED (similar to Eclipse), so JDK needs to be installed.  
   After installing, add the jdk bin folder to the Environment Variable.


3. Install RobotFramework and related libraries.

   Robot Framework is an open source automation framework for test automation and robotic process automation (RPA).  
   Go to the command prompt and do
   <pre><code>pip -r install requirements.txt</code></pre>
   See [here](https://github.com/Zocke07/Automation-Demonstration/blob/main/WebDemo/requirements.txt) for the requirements.


5. Download [chromedriver](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing) and put the file in the Python installation folder.

   Default location: C:/Users/<i>username</i>/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python310

2. Install [RED (Robot Editor)](https://github.com/nokia/RED/releases/tag/0.9.5). RED Robot Editor is Eclipse based editor for RobotFramework test cases.

   > We used RED 0.9.5 on our demonstration
