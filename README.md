# Automation Demonstration

This repository contains the resources and examples for our Special Topic Project ***Test Automation Best Practices: A Case Study Analysis***. This demonstration focuses on implementing test automation using the [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/) to demonstrate test automation processes.

This project aims to showcase the implementation of test automation in software development. By using the Robot Framework, we explore the best practices in automating tests for web applications, leveraging the power of the Selenium library for browser interactions.
